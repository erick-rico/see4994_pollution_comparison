# 📚 References & Notes – Week 3 (Sept 18–26)

## Literature Review – Mexico City Climatology & Pollution

1. **García (2023)** – O₃ trends (1987–2022):  
   - Decrease of 24% overall, but +17% in the last 8 years.  
   - Strong correlation with CO (R=0.81).  
   - Temperature +3 °C → Urban Heat Island effect.  

2. **García-Reynoso et al. (2023)** – O₃ chemistry:  
   - Nonlinear dependence on NOx and VOCs.  
   - “Weekend effect” shows VOC sensitivity.  
   - Control strategies should target VOCs (LPG leaks, solvents, domestic).  

3. **Burgos-Cuevas et al. (2021)** – ABL climatology (1990–2017):  
   - Inversions more frequent in winter/spring → pollutant accumulation.  
   - Dry season stability aligns with O₃/PM peaks.  

4. **Díaz-Esteban et al. (2022)** – Circulation patterns:  
   - High-pressure ridges → weak winds, high solar radiation → O₃, NO₂, PM peaks.  
   - ENSO modulation: La Niña = more pollution events, El Niño = fewer.  

5. **Mendez-Astudillo et al. (2022)** – UHI & UPI synergy:  
   - AUHI ≈ +3.4 °C nocturnal; SUHI ≈ +2.3 °C.  
   - Positive correlations: UHI–PM₂.₅ (r=0.39), UHI–PM₁₀ (r=0.50).  
   - PM₂.₅ higher in urban areas year-round; PM₁₀ sometimes higher in rural (dust).

## Air Quality Indices

### Mexico (IAyS – NOM-172-SEMARNAT-2023)
- Progressive tightening of PM bands (2024 → 2026).  
- NowCast 12h method for PMs.  
- Separate O₃ index (no longer combined 1h/8h).  
- Risk levels with health recommendations.  

### Hong Kong (AQHI)
- Composite, 3h moving average of O₃, NO₂, SO₂, PM.  
- Categories: 1–10+ (Low to Serious).  
- Based on local health risk studies.  

### WHO AQGs (2021)
- Stricter guidelines (PM₂.₅: 15 µg/m³ 24h, 5 annual; PM₁₀: 45 24h, 15 annual; O₃: 100 µg/m³ 8h).

## Notes
- Mexico’s NOM aligns closer to WHO than Hong Kong’s AQOs.  
- HK lacks pollutant-specific category bands → difficult direct comparability.  
- Dataset structures differ: HK = station-hour indices; CDMX = more heterogeneous.
