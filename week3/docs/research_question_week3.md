# Research Question (living)

## Main Question
How do Mexico City’s IAyS (NOM-172-2023) and Hong Kong’s AQHI differ in their design and thresholds, and what challenges arise when comparing them with WHO guidelines?

## Sub-questions
1. How do meteorological and climatological factors influence pollution episodes in Mexico City?  
2. What methodological differences exist between IAyS (pollutant thresholds, NowCast) and AQHI (composite risk, 3h averaging)?  
3. To what extent are Mexico’s new thresholds (2023–2026) aligned with WHO AQGs?  
4. What limitations prevent direct comparability of CDMX and HK datasets?  
5. What optional research lines could extend this work (e.g., exploring large raw datasets, meteorology integration)?  

## Rationale
- Extends Week 2 trend analysis into a **conceptual and normative comparison**.  
- Answers supervisor’s request: review climatology/meteorology literature + indices.  
- Highlights Mexico’s policy progress and dataset limitations.  
- Frames possible future directions without committing to heavy dataset recalculations.
