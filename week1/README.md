# Week 1 – Progress Report (Sept 4–11)

## 📌 Overview
First-pass exploration of HK vs Mexico City air quality. Set up repo structure, gathered initial data sources, and built quick plots. Drafted slides for the first check-in with Dr. Chu.

## 📂 Contents
- `notebook_week1.ipynb` → exploratory analysis and visuals.  
- `see4994_week1.pdf` → slides for meeting.  
- `data/` → raw and cleaned datasets for quick plotting; output plots.
- `docs/` → references, notes, week notebook & presentation; living research question.

## 📊 Key Findings / Outputs
- PM higher in urban/industrial areas.
- O₃ shows stronger peaks in rural/peripheral areas.  
- HK uses AQHI (risk-based), Mexico City uses IAS (category-based).  
- Early thought: adapting AQHI-style risk communication might clarify public messaging in Mexico City.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Follow further presentation reccomendation.  
- Improve comparability.  
- Sketch how AQHI could be mapped to Mexico City context (method note + example day).

## 🧾 References (Week 1)
- Hong Kong EPD – Air Quality & AQHI (official portals).  
- SEDEMA / DMA – Air quality datasets & IAS docs for Mexico City.

## ❓ Research Question (living)
*How do pollutant characteristics and their health risk indices (AQHI vs AQI) compare between Hong Kong and Mexico City, and what lessons can be drawn for improving public awareness and policy design in urban environments?*
